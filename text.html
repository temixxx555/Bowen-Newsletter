          <p>There once was a fish who lived in a pond
            She was lonely and bored, of her life she was not fond
            She wished for a friend, someone to share her days
            But all the other fish were dull and always in a haze.</p>

          <img src="" alt="">
          <span> </span>



          <p> One day, she saw a frog who sat on a lily pad
            He was singing a cheerful song, and he seemed very glad
            She swam up to him and said, "Hello, what is your name?"
            He smiled and said, "I'm Freddy, and I'm happy that you came."</p>
            <p>They started to talk and found they had much in common
              They liked the same music, the same jokes, and the same blossom
              They laughed and sang and played until the sun went down
              They felt a spark between them, a feeling so profound</p>
            <p>They met again the next day, and the day after that
              They grew closer and closer, and their hearts went pitter-pat
              They decided to be a couple, and they kissed under the moon
              They felt so lucky and so happy, they were over the moon</p>
              <p>But their happiness was short-lived, for their families did not approve
                They said, "You are too different, you can never make it work
                You belong to different worlds, you have different ways of life
                You will only bring each other pain, you will only cause strife."</p>
                <p>They tried to ignore them, but the pressure was too much
                  They felt torn and conflicted, they longed for each other's touch
                  They decided to run away, to find a place where they could be free
                  They packed their bags and left at night, they hoped to find their destiny</p>
                  <p>They traveled far and wide, but they could not find a home
                    They faced many dangers and hardships, they felt weary and alone
                    They realized that their love was not enough, they needed more than that
                    They needed a place where they could belong, where they could live in peace and harmony</p>
                    <p>They decided to part ways, with tears in their eyes
                      They said, "I love you, but I can't go on, this is our last goodbye
                      You will always be in my heart, you will always be my soulmate
                      But we have to face the truth, we have to accept our fate."</p>




          <img src="" alt="">
          <Span></Span>
          <p>They kissed one last time, and then they went their separate ways
            They never saw each other again, but they always remembered their days
            They learned a valuable lesson, that love is not always enough
            Sometimes, you have to let go, even if it's tough</p>
